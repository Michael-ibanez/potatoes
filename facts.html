          <h2> Fact 1: </h2>
          <p>
            Potatoes arrived in the Colonies in 1621 when the Governor of Bermuda, Nathaniel Butler, sent two large cedar chests containing potatoes and other vegetables to Governor Francis Wyatt of Virginia at Jamestown.
            The first permanent potato patches in North America were established in 1719, most likely near Londonderry (Derry), NH, by Scotch-Irish immigrants. From there, the crop spread across the country.

        <li>
          <h2> Fact 2: </h2>
          <p>
            Idaho, the present-day largest producer of potatoes, actually did not begin growing potatoes until 1836, when missionaries moved west in an effort to teach the native tribes to grow crops instead of relying upon hunting and gathering methods.
            However, it wasn’t until 1872 when the Russet Burbank variety was developed, that the Idaho potato industry began to flourish.

          <h2> Fact 3: </h2>
          <p>
            A. Parmentier helped King Louis XIV popularize the potato in France in the 18th century. Parmentier created a feast with only potato dishes, a concept he realized was possible when he was imprisoned in Germany and fed only potatoes.
            Benjamin Franklin, ambassador to France, was in attendance of Parmentier’s feast in 1767.

          <h2> Fact 4: </h2>
          <p>
            A potato is about 80% water and 20% solid.

          <h2> Fact 5: </h2>
          <p>
            The world’s largest potato was produced by Pringle’s Company in Jackson, TN, in 1990. It was 23″ x 14.5″.

          <h2> Fact 6: </h2>
          <p>
            The average American eats 140 pounds of potatoes per year. Germans eat more than 200

          <h2> Fact 8: </h2>
          <p>
            During the Alaskan Klondike gold rush, (1897-1898) potatoes were practically worth their weight in gold. Potatoes were valued for their vitamin C.  And gold, at that time, was more plentiful than nutritious foods!
            In October 1995, the potato became the first vegetable to be grown in space. NASA and the University of Wisconsin, Madison, created the technology with the goal of feeding astronauts on long space voyages, and eventually, feeding future space colonies.
